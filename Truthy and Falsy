check if a variable exists and you won’t necessarily want it to equal a specific value .

check to see if the variable has been assigned a value.

let myVariable = 'I Exist!';

if (myVariable) {
   console.log(myVariable)
} else {
   console.log('The variable does not exist.')
}

The code block in the if statement will run because myVariable has a truthy value; even though the value of myVariable is not explicitly the value true, when used in a boolean or conditional context, it evaluates to true because it has been assigned a non-falsy value.

So which values are falsy— or evaluate to false when checked as a condition? The list of falsy values includes:

0
Empty strings like "" or ''
null which represent when there is no value at all
undefined which represent when a declared variable lacks a value
NaN, or Not a Number

let wordCount = 10;

if (wordCount) {
  console.log("Great! You've started your work!");
} else {
  console.log('Better get to work!');
}


let favoritePhrase = '';

if (favoritePhrase) {
  console.log("This string doesn't seem to be empty.");
} else {
  console.log('This string is definitely empty.');
}
