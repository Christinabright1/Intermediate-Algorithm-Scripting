Here’s how you convert your age from “human years” to “dog years”:

The first two years of a dog’s life count as 10.5 dog years each.
Each year following equates to 4 dog years.

//I create a variable and i assign the value of my age
const myAge= 21;

let earlyYears = 2;

earlyYears *= 10.5;

laterYears= myAge -2;

laterYears *= 4;

myAgeInDogYears= earlyYears + laterYears;

const name= 'Christy';
const myName=  name.toLowerCase();

console.log(`My name is ${myName}. I am ${myAge}years old in human years which is ${myAgeInDogYears}years old in dog years`);
